# TwoAPIs411
JavaScript, HTML, and CSS project completed for a distributed-object computing course.

This assignment was to take two unrelated APIs and relate them in some way. For this project, I choose a hockey game API and a weather API to display the game information (date, team names, goals scored) alongside the amount of precipitation that occurred on the corresponding day.
- Created HTML webpage that accepts user input for date range, background color preference, and minimum number of goals scored during a game.
- Used JavaScript to connect to the APIs
- Used JavaScript to parse the data into my desired format for the project (precipitation was recorded by hour; I added logic to get the daily total instead.)\
- Used CSS to style the HTML page and data display table
